This repository contains a collection of small React projects I built while learning and improving my React skills.  
Each project helped me explore different concepts â€” from components and props to hooks, routing, and API integration.

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s Inside
- Mini React apps focusing on UI, logic, and state management  
- Practice with React Router, Tailwind CSS, and custom hooks  
- Hands-on work with APIs, form handling, and dynamic rendering  

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
- How to structure and organize React projects  
- Building reusable and responsive components  
- Managing state effectively with hooks  
- Connecting React apps to real APIs
